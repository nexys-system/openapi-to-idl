                        truth and I'll believe. But tell me a story and it will
                        live in my heart forever" - Native American proverb.
                        Stories are the most powerful way to help clients
                        understand how your services add real value to people
                        like them. Decisions are made on emotions supported by
                        facts. Stories link these two together. This module will
                        help you understand the importance of stories, how to
                        find them and how to structure them for biggest impact.

                        multiple contracts with many different vendors making it
                        complex and timeconsuming for them to manage. TSS
                        Multivendor Support Services allows the client to
